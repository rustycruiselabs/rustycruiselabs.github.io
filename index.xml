    <a href="#overview" class="header-mark"></a>Overview</h2><p>I am almost done with development for Rolling Mind and it&rsquo;s time to create a Splash Screen for my game&rsquo;s branding! It is kind of unexpected that there are so many things that have to be done to polish a game before releasing. One of it is creating a splash screen. Personally, I think splash screen is an important part of our game, as it gives our game an identity, where players would want to come back to for more, hopefully&hellip;?</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<h2 id="overview" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#overview" class="header-mark"></a>Overview</h2><p>It&rsquo;s Black Friday! and there was lots of sales going on the Unity Asset store. There were flash deals where assets were sold at a discounted price of 70% and many of the highly recommended assets were 50% off. I was weighing between the price of the assets &amp; the time saving I would have when developing games, and decided to splurge abit this round.</p>
<p>One of the unexpected things I found was the <strong>Humble Bundle</strong> where you can get a bunch of assets at a pretty great deal.</p>]]></description>

<p>“Rolling Mind” is a puzzle genre mobile game that challenges your mental rotation ability. It was a game which I found on a game show a couple of years back and was amazed at how challenging it could be with just a maze and a color cube. Human brains can be really powerful if we train ourselves for it. Hence, I thought it would be fun to develop a game around this concept.</p>]]></description>

<h2 id="whats-the-game-about" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#whats-the-game-about" class="header-mark"></a>What’s the Game About</h2><p>“Rolling Mind” is a puzzle genre mobile game that challenges your mental rotation ability. According to the National Institutes of Health, mental rotation is one aspect of spatial thinking that describes the ability to imagine an object turned around in the mind.</p>
<p>So here’s a little story about my inspiration. I got this idea from a brain game show a couple of years back and was amazed at how challenging it could be with just a maze and a color cube. Human brains can be really powerful if we train ourselves for it. Hence, I thought it would be fun to develop a game around this concept and that’s how mental rotation became the core concept of this game!</p>]]></description>
