warranties that may arise from course of dealing, course of performance, usage, or trade practice.</p>
<p>We do not make any representations or warranties regarding: (i) the operation or availability of our Service; (ii) the accuracy, reliability, or currency
of any information or content provided through our Service; (iii) the uninterrupted or error-free nature of our Service; or (iv) the absence of viruses,
scripts, trojan horses, worms, malware, or other harmful components in our Service, its servers, or communications sent from or on behalf of us.</p>
<p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of warranties or limitations on applicable statutory rights of a consumer, so some or all
of the above exclusions and limitations may not apply to you. In such cases, the exclusions and limitations set forth in this section shall be applied to the
greatest extent enforceable under applicable law.</p>
<h2 id="limitation-of-liability" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#limitation-of-liability" class="header-mark"></a>LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h2><p>In no event shall RustyCruise Labs, nor its directors, employees, partners, agents, suppliers, or affiliates, be liable for any indirect, incidental, special,
consequential, or punitive damages, including but not limited to, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses. This applies to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your access to or use of, or inability to access or use, the Service;</li>
<li>Any conduct or content of any third party on the Service;</li>
<li>Any content obtained from the Service;</li>
<li>Unauthorized access, use, or alteration of your transmissions or content.</li>
</ul>
<p>This limitation applies whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence), or any other legal theory, even if RustyCruise Labs has been advised of
the possibility of such damages and even if a remedy fails its essential purpose. Some jurisdictions may not allow the exclusion of certain types of damages,
so some of the above limitations may not apply to you.</p>
<h2 id="indemnification" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#indemnification" class="header-mark"></a>Indemnification</h2><p>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless RustyCruise Labs, its affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents from and
against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, arising out of or in any way connected with your
access to or use of our Services, your violation of these Terms, or your infringement of any third-party rights, including intellectual property rights.</p>
<h2 id="dispute-resolution" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#dispute-resolution" class="header-mark"></a>Dispute Resolution</h2><p>If you have any concerns or disputes regarding the Service, you agree to first attempt to resolve the issue informally by contacting RustyCruise Labs. We encourage
you to reach out to us directly to discuss and resolve any issues before pursuing formal dispute resolution methods.</p>
<p>If the dispute cannot be resolved informally, you agree to participate in mediation or other alternative dispute resolution procedures as a prerequisite to initiating
any formal legal action. This may include, but is not limited to, arbitration or mediation, as specified in the Terms of Service.</p>
<p>Any formal disputes must be brought in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations governing the Service, and any legal proceedings must be conducted in the
jurisdiction specified in the Terms of Service.</p>
<h2 id="governing-law" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#governing-law" class="header-mark"></a>GOVERNING LAW</h2><p>These Terms and Conditions, and all subsequent variations, shall be subject to, governed by, and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the Republic of Singapore,
without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Any action brought by you arising from your use of the Service shall be exclusively domiciled in Singapore and resolved
through binding arbitration in accordance with the rules of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC).</p>
<p>Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or
unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions will remain in effect. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us regarding our Service and supersede any
prior agreements between us regarding the Service.</p>
<h3 id="for-european-union-eu-users" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#for-european-union-eu-users" class="header-mark"></a>For European Union (EU) Users</h3><p>If you are a European Union consumer, you will benefit from any mandatory provisions of the law of the country in which you are resident.</p>
<h3 id="singapore-legal-compliance" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#singapore-legal-compliance" class="header-mark"></a>Singapore Legal Compliance</h3><p>You represent and warrant that (i) you are not located in a country that is subject to a Singapore government embargo or that has been designated by the Singapore government
as a “terrorist-supporting” country, and (ii) you are not listed on any Singapore government list of prohibited or restricted parties.</p>
<h2 id="severability" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#severability" class="header-mark"></a>SEVERABILITY</h2><p>If any provision of these Terms and Conditions is or becomes illegal, invalid, or unenforceable in any respect, the legality, validity, or enforceability of the remaining
provisions shall not be affected or impaired.</p>
<h2 id="waiver" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#waiver" class="header-mark"></a>WAIVER</h2><p>Except as provided herein, the failure to exercise a right or to require performance of an obligation under these Terms shall not affect a party&rsquo;s ability to exercise such
right or require such performance at any time thereafter, nor shall the waiver of a breach constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="changes" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#changes" class="header-mark"></a>CHANGES</h2><p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. By continuing to access or use our
Service after any revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. If you do not agree to the new terms,
you are no longer authorized to use our Service.</p>
