      <description>Overview&amp;ldquo;Rolling Mind&amp;rdquo; is a mobile puzzle game designed to push the boundaries of your spatial cognition. Developed with insights from the National Institutes of Health, it focuses on mental rotation, a critical component of spatial thinking. Mental rotation entails envisioning objects from different angles in the mind&amp;rsquo;s eye. In &amp;ldquo;Rolling Mind,&amp;rdquo; players are tasked with navigating 3D objects along specified paths, challenging their capacity to visualize and manipulate spatial configurations.</description>
