      <description>After my first game jam experience in July 2023, I was inspired by the games created by fellow game developers and fell in a love with the game development process. My skills were seriously lacking, so I spent lots of time after the game jam to hone my skills through tutorials, forums, YouTube videos and even ChatGPT.&#xA;There’s nothing faster in learning than to put my skills into practice. Hence, I am currently working on a new game called “Rolling Mind” which is a puzzle based game.</description>
